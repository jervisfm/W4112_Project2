# COMS W4112 Project 2

This project contains an implementation of Algorithm 4.11 from
[Selection Conditions in Main Memory]. This algorithm optimizes SQL
plans for to minimize branch prediction costs using a dynamic
programming algorithm. This algorithm's cost is O(4^n).

# Usage

1. `$ git clone https://github.com/jervisfm/W4112_Project2`
2. `$ cd W4112_Project2`
3. `$ make`
4. `$ ./stage2.sh query.txt config.txt`
