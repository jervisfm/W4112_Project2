# COMS W4112 Project 2

This project contains an implementation of Algorithm 4.11 from
[Selection Conditions in Main Memory]. This algorithm optimizes SQL
plans for to minimize branch prediction costs using a dynamic
programming algorithm. This algorithm's cost is O(4^n).

# Usage

`$ git clone https://github.com/jervisfm/W4112_Project2`
`$ cd W4112_Project2`
`$ make`
`$ ./stage2.sh query.txt config.txt`
